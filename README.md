# Mobile Application built with React Native

This is the front-end of the application I created for my dissertation  
at the University of Southampton

The purpose of the application is to serve as a  
lifestyle diary for its' users. Users havea a diary,  
where they can log ativities such as training, nutrition, and sleep.

The goal is to provide a smooth User Experience.
